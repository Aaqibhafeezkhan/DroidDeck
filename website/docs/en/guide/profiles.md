# Profiles

A **profile** is a page of buttons. On the phone, swipe sideways to switch profiles; the app opens on
the last profile you used. An **Open profile** button shows another profile as a folder (see
[Buttons & actions](actions.md#open-profile-and-back)), and Android's **Back** closes the folder.

The **Profile** button, the sliders icon in the deck's top bar, opens the profile's name and
automatic switching. In the PC configurator the same dialog opens from the pencil above the grid.

## Switch profile with the focused app { #auto-switch }

Under **Profile → Open with the app in focus**, list the programs that bring
this profile up. When one of them gets focus on the PC, the deck switches to the profile on its own;
when focus moves to another program, the deck goes back to where it was.

- Use the process name without `.exe`: `obs64`, `Code`, `chrome`, `Photoshop`. The dialog suggests
  the programs open on the PC right now.
- If you swipe to another page while an automatic profile is showing, the deck won't switch back
  on its own afterwards.
- To turn automatic switching off on a phone, use **Settings → Appearance → Follow the focused app**.

## Backup { #backup }

A backup is a `.droiddeck` file with every profile, button images included.

- **In the PC configurator**: **Export backup** and **Import backup**, in the
  sidebar.
- **On the phone**: **Settings → Export deck backup** opens Android's share sheet (Drive,
  e-mail, "Save to files"…). To import, use the configurator on the PC.

Importing adds the file's profiles. A profile that already exists (the same profile, from an earlier
backup) is replaced by the file's version; the others stay as they are. **Open profile** buttons keep
pointing to the right folders.

To share a single profile, or bring one in from an Elgato Stream Deck, see
[Import & share](import-share.md).

!!! info "Backups with privileged actions"
    A backup with hotkey, launch-app or HTTP-request buttons can only be imported from the configurator
    on the PC, under the same security rule as the buttons themselves.

## Without a connection to the PC { #offline }

The phone keeps the last deck it received. If the PC is off or off the network, the app opens that
deck right away with a **PC desconectado** (PC disconnected) notice, and buttons tell you the PC didn't
answer. When the connection comes back the deck reloads on its own.

## Several PCs { #pcs }

A phone can control more than one PC. To add another, pair with its QR code (or type its IP) in
**Settings**: it joins the **Paired PCs** list, with its Windows name.

- To switch, tap the PC in the list, or use the computer icon in the deck's top bar (shown with two or
  more PCs).
- Each PC has its own deck, its own integrations and its own saved copy for [offline mode](#offline).
- Each PC's menu has **Rename** and **Forget this PC**.

## Edit mode

On the phone, holding a button opens the editor. On a button that has a **long-press** action,
holding runs that action instead; to edit it, tap the **pencil** in the deck's top bar (edit mode):
while it is on, tapping any button opens the editor.
